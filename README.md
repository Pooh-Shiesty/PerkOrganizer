# Perk Organizer

Perk Organizer to help artists create DBD Packs with ease.


## Build instructions

```python
pip install nuitka
python -m nuitka --standalone main.py
```

Afterwards check the `main.dist` folder for `main.exe` and then drag it to the same directory where the `images` and `output` folders are located (important!).
Then you can rename `main.exe` to whatever you want and then just put your images in the `images` folder and run the executable and check
output once it's done.
